- **Instructions for Forking, Cloning Repositories and creating a new Branch**:  
  1. Click the link for each repository above.
  2. Click the **Fork** button (top right) to create your own copy.
  3. Make sure that you fork ***ALL*** branches (the `solutions` branch has completed code in it!)
  4. Once forked, click the **Code** button and copy the URL.
  5. Clone to your local machine using:  
     ```bash
     git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
     ```
  6. Create a branch for you to work on using:
     ```bash
     git switch -c <your-branch-name>
     ```
     This ensures that the `main` branch can receive updates more easily from the upstream.

- **How to Follow Along with Demonstrations**:  
  - Make sure you have forked and cloned all required repositories before the session.
  - Check for any setup instructions in each repo’s README.
  - As demonstrations proceed, commit your work to your fork.
  - If you get stuck, refer to the instructor’s repo or ask for help.
